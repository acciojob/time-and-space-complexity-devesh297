	<h1>Understanding Time, Space, and Complexity</h1>

    <p>Time complexity measures the amount of time an algorithm takes to run as a function of input size. Efficient algorithms have lower time complexity, making them suitable for large datasets.</p>

    <p><b>Space Complexity</b> refers to the amount of memory required by an algorithm as a function of input size. For example, an algorithm with <b>Space Complexity</b> of O(n) uses memory proportional to the input size.</p>
